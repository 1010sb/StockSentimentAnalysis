## NextEra (NEE)

To sum it up when looking at NextEra we can observe a very weak positive correlation, between daily sentiment scores and daily stock price changes. This means that as sentiment increases there is a mi-nor tendency for stock prices to show some positive movement. The presence of the associated regres-sion line, which has a slightly upward slope further supports the idea of a noticeable yet relatively weak positive connection, between daily sentiment scores and daily stock price changes.

## Palantir (PLTR)
To summarize based on a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.4786 and a low p value of 0.000000 for Palantir (PLTR) we can conclude that there is a significant and moderate positive correlation, between daily sentiment scores and daily stock price changes. The data indicates that when there is a rise, in sentiment expressed in social media conversations it is likely that Palantir's stock prices will also show a trend. Additionally the presence of a regression line with a slope supports the idea that there is a moder-ate positive connection between daily sentiment scores and daily changes, in stock prices.

## Procter and Gamble (PG)
To summarize the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.1062, along with the p value of 0.003077 for Procter and Gamble (PG) indicates a significant but relatively weak positive correlation between daily sentiment scores and daily stock price changes. Moreover the presence of a regression line with an slope further supports the notion of this apparent yet somewhat modest positive association, between daily sentiment scores and daily stock price changes.

## Tesla (TSLA)
To summarize the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.4991 along with the p value of 0.00000 for Tesla Inc (TSLA) indicates a statistically significant and moderately strong positive correlation between daily sentiment scores and daily changes in stock prices. This correlation suggests that as sentiments in so-cial media discussions increase with positive sentiment there is a tendency for Tesla stock prices to move in a positive direction. Additionally the presence of a sloping regression line further supports this relationship shedding light on the significant impact of social media sentiment, on Tesla stock price dy-namics and market behavior.

## Conclusion
This investigation focused on exploring how social media sentiment on StockTwits relates to the chang-es, in stock prices for five known companies; Procter & Gamble (PG) NextEra (NEE) Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Palantir (PLTR) and Tesla Inc (TSLA). To understand this relationship we used the Spearman Correlation Coefficient and P Values. During the period of June 1 2020 to June 30 2023 a total of 4,160,867 tweets were collected for these companies.

The study revealed correlation patterns among these companies. Procter & Gamble and NextEra showed a "Very Weak" correlation indicating that their stock prices are not significantly influenced by so-cial media sentiment. On the hand Nvidia Corporation displayed a "Weak" correlation suggesting that sentiment does play a role but is not the dominant factor affecting its stock prices. Palantir demonstrated a "Moderate" correlation indicating that social media sentiment has an impact on its stock prices. Lastly Tesla Inc stood out with a "Moderate to Strong" correlation emphasizing that social media sentiment has an influence, on its market performance.

These findings provide valuable insights for investors and financial analysts, emphasizing the im-portance of comprehending the varying degrees of susceptibility among these companies to social me-dia sentiment fluctuations. Companies with weaker correlations, such as Procter & Gamble and Nex-tEra, may continue to rely primarily on traditional market drivers. Conversely, companies like Tesla Inc, with stronger correlations, are notably sensitive to public sentiment, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring of online discussions and public perception.
This study not only illuminates the complex interplay between social media mood and stock price changes but it also suggests various directions for further investigation. First and foremost it is important to make it clear that correlation does not indicate causation. This encourages deeper investigation of causal connections between social media opinion and stock price behavior. Examining the effects of outside variables, such as macroeconomic circumstances, business-specific news, and industry-specific events, can help to get a more complete knowledge of the elements that affect stock price. Further-more combining cutting edge sentiment analysis methods with machine learning models can improve the accuracy of next research projects.
